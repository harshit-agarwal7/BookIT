# BookIT

This is a web-app for trading books created by Ayushree Gangal, Venkatesh Thapan, and me. It was the final project of the course Advanced Programming. A large part of the work was done by Ayushree Gangal.

To run the project, execute `python manage.py runserver`. The server will start running on your local machine and the address the server machine will be return. Copy that address and paste it on your web browser to interact with the webapp.
